# bragle v1

This was my first SB script, and it was themed after my dog, like bragle v2, v3, v4, and v5.

The instant I first ran this over a year ago, someone logged it and ran it. I asked where they got it from and they said "their friend gave it to them."

Weird stuff include:

- Using a module for killing LC v1
- Using Explosions for hit detection
- Using a module for lightning
- I actually went through FoxIs_Here's inventory to figure out what the stop key was for Rainbow™️, since I saw Bro_Daneel use it and couldn't kill him (this was done in commit f0c0d3f047ac62c541245a67a2227131def4667f)

The script could kill:

- LC v1
- CR template scripts
- Old lightning cannon
- Scripts with antideath that use :Clone
